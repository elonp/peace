# Support Peace in Palenstine-Israel - Stand with Both Peoples

| ![Badge One](badge_1.svg) | ![Badge Two](badge_2.svg) |  ![QR to Self](qr-to-self.svg) |

## Why?

There are two peoples in the Palestine/Israel.  Any solution to the conflict must first acknowledge this very basic fact.

Both sides believe they are fighting for their very survival.  If you wave one flag, whether it's the Israeli or the Palestinian, you are reinforcing the belief of the other side that no-one will come to their aid if they lose that fight.  This can only lead to further disregard for the humanity of the other side and further atrocities.

This is what I hoped to convey in the graphics above.

## What can you do?

There are various online service that would print on button badges, stickers, etc.  Here's one: [BananaPrint](https://www.banana-print.co.uk/button-badges/).

If you're in the UK and a few badges, I'd be happy mail them to you.  Feel free to contact me for that or for anything else:

As you can see, I am not a web designer.  Advice is welcome.

## Who am I?

There is no organization behind this web page, just me, Elon Portugaly.

I do not plan to create an organization, but if some organization would like to take on this effort, I will gladly cooperate.

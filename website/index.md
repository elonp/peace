# Support Peace in Palenstine-Israel - Stand with Both Peoples

| ![Support Peace Button](button.svg) |  ![QR to Self](qr-to-self.png) |

## Why?

There are two peoples in the Palestine/Israel.  Any solution to the conflict must first acknowledge this very basic fact.

Both sides believe they are fighting for their very survival.  If you wave one flag, whether it's the Israeli or the Palestinian, you are reinforcing the belief of the other side that no-one will come to their aid if they lose that fight.  This can only lead to further disregard for the humanity of the other side and further atrocities.

This is what I hoped to convey in the graphics above.
